# Spring Boot with MongoDB

## Overview

This project aims to provide a practical understanding of the main differences between the document-oriented and relational paradigms, as well as to allow the implementation of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It also aims to reflect on design decisions for a document-oriented database and the implementation of associations between objects, including nested objects and references.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamental differences between document-oriented and relational databases.
- Implement CRUD operations using Spring Boot and MongoDB.
- Reflect on design decisions for data modeling in a document-oriented database.
- Implement associations between objects using MongoDB: nested objects, references.
- Perform queries using Spring Data and MongoRepository to interact with MongoDB efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- MongoDB
- Spring Data MongoDB

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/config`: Contains configuration files for the application.
- `/domain`: Contains domain models and entity classes.
- `/dto`: Contains data transfer objects (DTOs).
- `/repository`: Contains repository interfaces for interacting with MongoDB.
- `/resources`: Contains application resources, such as configuration files.
- `/services`: Contains service classes for business logic implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher installed.
- MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible remotely.
- IDE of your choice (recommended: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
- Maven or Gradle installed for dependency management (recommended: Maven).
